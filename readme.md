# About Me!
My name is Jessica and I am a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
I am from Colorado, and I enjoy spending some of my free time trying out new artsy hobbies.
I also am in two Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, and I really love playing my character [Lena](https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/cinderqu33n/characters/30178371).<br>

## Interests
I am interested in archives and academic librarianship. <br>
In the past I have studied:
1. Fairy Tales
2. Folk lore
3. European history
	1. German history from 1840-1950
	2. European history from 1840-1950

My most recent research project was on using fairytales as a commentary on newspapers, through the book [Extra! Fairy Tales Up to Now](https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9912411747902121). <br>

## Tools
I don't have a lot of existing knowledge of existing tools that people use in DH projects but I am excited to learn python and maybe Omeka. <br>
I really like the super interactive tools that we've seen on some of the sites, and I think that might be interesting to learn. <br>
